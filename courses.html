                <p>Per capita Electrical Energy Consumption is an index of the standard of living of a country and its industrial and economic potential. Needless to say, that our country is very badly lagging behind in this area. The realization has now dawned that if India were to achieve a sustained annual economic growth of around 10%, it would have to improve its infrastructure including power generation by a factor of at least two. The government has all the intention of doing it and power generation is now under sharp focus. Simultaneously, the field of electronics is advancing in a big way and finds its application in almost every field, be it communications, power generation, automation, defense, consumer, electronics, automobile engineering, control engineering or aerospace applications.

                    There is a huge deficit in the demand and supply of well-qualified Electrical Engineers in the country. With this view the Electrical Department was started. The department has following fully equipped laboratories of Electrical Engineering</p>
                <br>
                <p>Research and specialization can be carried out in any of the following fields:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Circuit Analysis</li>
                    <li>Electro-Magnetism</li>
                    <li>Solid-State Electronics</li>
